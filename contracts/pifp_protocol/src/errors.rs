//! # Error Catalogue
//!
//! Every error the PIFP protocol contract can return is defined here as a
//! [`contracterror`] enum.  Soroban surfaces these to callers as
//! `Error(Contract, #N)` where `N` is the discriminant value.
//!
//! ## Error codes at a glance
//!
//! | Code | Variant                  | Typical trigger                                             |
//! |------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
//! |  1   | `ProjectNotFound`        | Querying or operating on a project ID that does not exist   |
//! |  2   | `MilestoneNotFound`      | Reserved for future milestone-level operations              |
//! |  3   | `MilestoneAlreadyReleased` | Calling `verify_and_release` on an already-completed project |
//! |  4   | `InsufficientBalance`    | Refund requested but donator has zero balance for that token |
//! |  5   | `InvalidMilestones`      | Reserved for future milestone validation                    |
//! |  6   | `NotAuthorized`          | Caller lacks the RBAC role required for the operation       |
//! |  7   | `InvalidGoal`            | Goal is ≤ 0 or exceeds the 10^30 upper bound               |
//! |  8   | `AlreadyInitialized`     | `init` called more than once                                |
//! |  9   | `RoleNotFound`           | Reserved for role-query edge cases                          |
//! | 10   | `TooManyTokens`          | `accepted_tokens` list exceeds the 10-token cap             |
//! | 11   | `InvalidAmount`          | Deposit or transfer amount is ≤ 0                           |
//! | 12   | `DuplicateToken`         | `accepted_tokens` contains the same address twice           |
//! | 13   | `InvalidDeadline`        | Deadline is in the past or more than 5 years in the future  |
//! | 14   | `ProjectExpired`         | Operation attempted on a project whose deadline has passed  |
//! | 15   | `ProjectNotActive`       | Deposit/verify attempted on a Completed or invalid-status project |
//! | 16   | `VerificationFailed`     | Submitted proof hash does not match the stored proof hash   |
//! | 17   | `EmptyAcceptedTokens`    | `accepted_tokens` list is empty at registration             |
//! | 18   | `Overflow`               | Arithmetic overflow on balance addition                     |
//! | 19   | `ProtocolPaused`         | Mutating operation attempted while the protocol is paused   |
//! | 20   | `GoalMismatch`           | Reserved for cross-token goal validation                    |
//! | 21   | `ProjectNotExpired`      | Refund or expire attempted before the deadline has passed   |
//! | 22   | `InvalidTransition`      | State-machine transition not allowed (e.g. expiring a Completed project) |
//! | 23   | `TokenNotAccepted`       | Deposit attempted with a token not in the project's accepted list |
//! | 24   | `RefundWindowActive`     | Creator tried to reclaim funds before the 6-month refund window expired |
//! | 25   | `RefundWindowExpired`    | Donor tried to refund after the 6-month refund window expired |
